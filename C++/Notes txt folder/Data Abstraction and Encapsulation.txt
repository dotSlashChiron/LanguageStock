The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit (class) is known as encapsulation. The data is not accessible to the outside world and only those functions which are wrapped inside the class can access it. These functions provide the interface between the object's data and the program.This insulation of data from direct access by the program is called data hiding or information hiding.
