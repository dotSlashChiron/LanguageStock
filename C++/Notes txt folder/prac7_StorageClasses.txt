TYPES OF STORAGE CLASSES
-> A storage class of variable specifies the lifetime and visiblilty of a variable within the program 
-> Lifetime refers to the longevity of a variable or the duration till which a variabe remains active during program execution
-> Visibility signifies the scope of a variable in which the program modules the variables is accessible
Types of Storage Classes

1. auto 
PURPOSE: To store local variables used in a single function
- The default storage class of any type of variable 
- Initial Value is garbage value
- Lifetime is limited till the time its container function is executing
- Visibilty is restricted to the function in which it is declared
- Stored in the stack segment

2. extern
PURPOSE: Stores the global Variables which are used throughout the program
- It is declared outside of the function and is accessible in any of the function
- An extern declaration cannot appear in class scope.
- Cannot be used in functin parameters
- Initial value is 0 
- The lifetime of an external variable is same as the lifetime of a program
- Any function can use it for its utility
- Stores data in data segment

3. static 
PURPOSE: Stoers local variables retaining their values throughout the program
- Visibility of a local variable 
- Initial value is 0 
- Lifetime of an external variable
- It does not get destroyed after a function is executed but it retains(saves) its value so that it can be used by any other function
- Stores data in data segment

4. register (somehwhat similar to auto)
PURPOSE: Variables using CPU Registers for storage purpose and for faster access
- Initial value is garbage value
- The objective is to increase the access speed (makes the programs faster)
- Visibility is limited to function block only
- Lifetime is only in the function block
- Stores data in CPU Registers
