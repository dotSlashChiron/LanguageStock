- Pointer is a derived data type that refers to another data variable by storing the variable's memory address rather than data

- A Pointer variable defines where to get specific value of a specific data variable instead of defining the actual data.

- A Pointer can point to another Pointer in C++ like C.
- A Pointer is initialized with syntax 
->   data-type *pointer-variable;

- Void pointers are also called as generic pointers which refer to variables of any data-type. !We must type cast the variables to the specific data type

- Dereferencing a pointer means to get the content of the memory location that the pointer points to.
- After assigning of the variable to a pointer, we can change the content of the variable using the dereference operator.

- Before dereferencing a pointer, it is essential to assign a value to the pointer. If we attempt to dereference an uninitialized pointer. it will cause runtime error by referring to any other location in memory

- The memory address of array elements can't be changed, whereas the content of pointer variables, that is the memory address that it refers to, can be changed.

* Two Different Ways of pointing to arrays
int number[] = {};
int *ptr = &number[0]; 
//or 
ptr = number
